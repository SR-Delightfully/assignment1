                Introduction:<br />
                When many people here the word "Pangolin" they assume that you're just mispronouncing "Penguins". 
                However, make no mistake, Pangolins are infact another type of animal, and unforunately is one of the many animal species
                that are listed on the endangered species list. <mark>All eight different species of Pangolin are listed, ranging from <strong>Vulnerable</strong> all the way to <strong>Critically Endangered</strong>.</mark>

                <dfn>The name of the species derives from the Malaysian word "pengguling"<br /> that means "one who rolls up".</dfn>

                Pangolins have large overlapping plate-like scares. These scales are soft when the they're newborns and harden as they age.<br />
                Their appearance is often compared to that of a pine cone, and similar to an armadillo pangolins will curl into a ball when scared.
                Their scales are made of Keratin and work as armor in case of an attack.</p>
            <p>
                Pangolins are small, short-legged creatures with sharp claws that they use for climbing, and scavenging. they like to burrow into ant and termite mounds. <br />
                Similar to skunks, Pangolins can also emit a noxious-smelling chemical.<br />
                Pangolins are also known to have extremely long tongues.<br />
                <i>Large pangolins can extend their tongues up to 40cm!</i>

                <big id="nav2">Behaviour:</big><br />
                Most pangolins are nocturnal creatures, meaning they spend most of their waking hours during the nighttime and rest during the day.<br />
                However, unlike the other species, long-tailed pangolins tend to be active during the day time instead. <br />
                Another species that differs from the others are the Arboreal pangolins whom live in hollow trees as opposed to the tunnels that the other pangolins tend to prefer.
            </p>
            <p>
                It should also be noted that some pangolins may walk with their front claws bent under their footpads. <br />
                When they climb however, they use the entirety of the foot bad on their hind legs. Others may choose a bipedal stance and may walk a few steps bipedally. <br />
                <sub><dfn>Bipedalism: "is a form of terrestrial locomotion where an animal moves by means of its two rear (or lower) limbs or legs."</dfn></sub>

                <big id="nav3">Diet:</big><br>
                Pangolins are insectivorous creatues, meaning their diet consists mainly of varying species of ants and termites.<br />
                These may be supplemented by other insects and larvae. They can be quite particular about what they consume, usually only eating one or two species of insects even if more may be available to them.<br />
                Pangolins can consume between 140-200g of insects each day. They are a key regulator of the termite population in their habitats.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pangolins have poor vision and lack teeth. They rely on smell and hearing as well as other physical traits that aide them in finding ants and termites to eat. <br />
                They also have sticky saliva that help the ants and termites stick to their tongue. <br />
                Because they dont have teeth, pangolins cannot chew. This means that while they're foraging
